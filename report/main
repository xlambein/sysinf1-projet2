read all input integers
push them to heap

while heap is not empty:

    get toFact from heap

    for i in 1..n:
        init thread i with (start=1+i, step=n)
    end

    for i in 1..n:
        join thread i
    end

    divide heap by toFact

    if no divison possible:
        toFact is the solution
        print it and exit
    end

end

(if the loop ends input is invalid)
